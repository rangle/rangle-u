# Mobile Development Challenges: Brainstorm

# Mobile Development Challenges

- Development Flow and Speed (Web to Mobile)
- React Native limitations dictates design/development
- Navigating Native IDEs
- Multiple Android versions (React Native favours iOS)
- Distribution (favours Android)
- No major version (i.e. Navigation is now becoming stable)
- Incorporating SDKs (and plugins)
- Picking up native development
- JS thread performance (Android slower compared to iOS)
- Performance impacts
